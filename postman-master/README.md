# postman
Pre-built Postman (getpostman.com) collections for multiple versions of Element OS.

Postman is an API testing suite that makes it easy to test formatting of API calls.  Collections are provided in this repo for multiple Element OS versions.  Collections have all calls organized for easy identification.

We provide an MVIP variable in all commands to simplify use.  You can define this variable by going to Manage Environments and adding a new key:value pair
Key: MVIP
Value: The Management VIP for SolidFire cluster

Please keep in mind that this tool can, and will, execute commands on active systems.  We recommend always test on non-production targets.
